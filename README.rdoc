Welcome to Fencing Coach Rails!

My personal project that I have been working on.

This app is designed to help fencing clubs with organizing and managing pools for the teams.
It also will show statisitcs when I get there and has an easy display so students can see how they should write down pool scores.

This app uses ruby v 2.1.1p.76 and Rails v 4.1.0

The database is postgres
